                    <h1>Census 1971</h1>
                    <h2 id="ADT15HH_1971">Adults aged 15 or over in household</h2><p>Age is the completed years of age at the census date and was calculated from the date of birth given in reply to question 32 on the household form or question 2 on the personal form. The question was <br><br>Write the date of birth of the person. <br><br>Day Month Year  <br><br>A household (equivalent to the term private household used in recent censuses) is either one person living alone, or a group of persons (who may or may not be related) living at the same address with common housekeeping. Persons staying temporarily with the household are included. A boarder having at least one meal a day with the household counts as a member of the household (breakfast counts as a meal for this purpose); but a lodger taking no meals with the main household counts as a separate one-person household, even if he shares kitchen and bathroom. A group of unrelated persons sharing a house or flat would count as one or as several households according to whether they maintained common housekeeping or provided their own meals separately. It was the enumerator’s responsibility to ascertain how many households were present at a given address and to obtain a completed household form from each: his conclusions were not amended in the Census Offices except that in the case of more than one household sharing a single room or sharing a caravan such households were amalgamated to form a single household. </p>
                    <h2 id="AGE_1971">Age</h2><p>Age is the completed years of age at the census date and was calculated from the date of birth given in reply to question 32 on the household form or question 2 on the personal form. The question was <br><br>Write the date of birth of the person. <br><br>Day Month Year  </p>
                    <h2 id="AGEDEP_1971">Age of dependent children</h2><p>Age is the completed years of age at the census date and was calculated from the date of birth given in reply to question 32 on the household form or question 2 on the personal form. The question was <br><br>Write the date of birth of the person. <br><br>Day Month Year   <br><br>Dependent children: are ddldren in families who are either: (a) under 15 years of age. or <br><br>(b) under 25 years of age and classified as student (that is, if present at address of enumeralion on census night answering to question B8 on the household form, or if absent having ‘Student' entered in reply to question C4 which asked for particulars of the job held in the week before Census for absent persons). </p>
                    <h2 id="AMEN_1971">Amenities</h2><p>Household amenities are cookers or cooking stoves, kitchen sinks, fixed baths or showers, hot water supplies and flush toilets. Information about the possession of these and the extent to which they were shared by other households, and whether toilets were available inside or outside was obtained from answers to question A5. The question was: <br><br>Has your household the use of the following amenities on these premises? <br><br>3. <br><br>A cooker or cooking stove with an oven <br><br>A kitchen sink permanently connected to a water supply and a waste <br><br>Pipe <br><br>A fixed bath or shower permanently connected to a water supply and a waste pipe <br><br>A hot water supply (to a washbasin, or kitchen sink, or bath, or shower) from a heating appliance or boiler <br><br>which is connected to a piped water <br><br>Simply A flush toilet (WC) with entrance inside the dwelling <br><br>A flush toilet (WC) with entrance outside the dwelling <br><br>1 [:1 YES - for use only by this household <br><br>2 [3 YES for use also by another household 3 III NO <br><br>1 [3 YES — for use only by this household <br><br>2 [:1 YES — for use also by another household 3 III N0 <br><br>1 E] YES - for use only by this household <br><br>2 U YES — for use also by another household 3 D NO <br><br>1 [:1 YES - for use only by this household <br><br>2 E] YES — for use also by another household <br><br>BEINO <br><br>1 '3 YES — for use only by this household <br><br>2 U YES — for use also by another household 3 [:1 NO <br><br>YES * for use only by this household <br><br>2 D YES — for use also by another household <br><br>The answers to questions A521 and A5b on the sharing of cookers, or cooking stoves, and sinks, were used in the classification of type of household space. <br><br>Some additional notes on the amenities questions were provided to the enumerator in 1971 to assist him when asked for advice. These were briefly: <br><br>kitchen sink: a wash hand basin should not be counted <br><br>hot water supply: geyser over a sink etc counts but not a copper from which water has to be transferred by hand to the sink, bath etc. <br><br>flush toilet: any toilet which can be flushed into a sewer, cesspit etc should be counted, even if the cistern is temporarily broken. <br><br>Householders who omitted part e (inside flush toilet) or part f (outside flush toilet) while answering ‘Yes’ to the other part, were assumed not to have the omitted amenity. If more than one answer was given to any part of the question, the lowest-numbered answer <br><br>was accepted, that is exclusive use before shared was used for classification and shared use before no use. </p>
                    <h2 id="CAROWN_1971">Car ownership</h2><p>Tables were produced analysing households by the number of cars and vans available for use by household members from the answers given to question A4. The question was <br><br>How many cars and vans are normally available for use by you or members of your household(other than visitors)? <br><br>Include any provided by employers if normally available for use by you or members of your household, but exclude vans used solely for the carriage of goods. <br><br>If None, write ‘NONE’. </p>
                    <h2 id="CHDBORN_1971">Children ever born</h2><p>The variable records the number of children ever born to females in private households where the married females were aged 16 to 59.<br>The number children included those who were not present in the household at the Census and those who died before the Census.<br>The number of children was recorded per 100 married females</p>
                    <h2 id="COB_1971">Country of birth</h2><p>A person’s country of birth was obtained from the answer given to question B9 on the household form, or question 9 0n the personal form. The question was asked in respect of all enumerated persons. The question (B9) was<br>a If the person was born in England or Wales or Scotland or Northern Ireland tick the appropriate box.<br>b If the person was born in another country, write the name of the country (using the name by which it is known today) and the year in which the person first entered the United Kingdom (that is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland).<br>a Born in<br>England <br>Scotland<br>Wales (including Monmouthshire)<br>Northern Ireland <br>or b born in (country) and entered UK in (year)<br><br>Classification of country of birth<br>For the classification of country of birth the United Kingdom has been taken to include Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man as well as England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; Guernsey has been taken to include all the Channel Islands other than Jersey.<br>Persons born outside the United Kingdom as defined above, are divided into visitors to the United Kingdom and residents in the United Kingdom.<br><br>Visitors to the United Kingdom are persons whose usual address is outside the United Kingdom, as defined above.<br>Note: an entry of ‘Visitor’ in answer to question B5 on the household form (asking for relationship of each person to the head of the household) is not used to distinguish between visitors and residents.<br><br>Residents in the United Kingdom are persons whose usual address is in the United Kingdom, as defined above.<br>Irish Republic includes cases in which the country of birth was returned as ‘Ireland’, except in tables where these cases are shown separately as Ireland (part not stated).<br><br>The Old Commonwealth consists of Australia, Canada and New Zealand.<br>The New Commonwealth is the Commonwealth outside the United Kingdom and Old<br>Commonwealth as at 1971; the term New Commonwealth in the tables therefore includes Pakistan.<br>The New Commonwealth is subdivided into:<br>Africa — Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and other African Commonwealth (including Ascension Island, Botswana, British Indian Ocean Territories, Gambia, Lesotho, Mauritius, Seychelles, St Helena, Swaziland and Tristan da Cunha);<br><br>America Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other and unspecified countries in America (including Bahama Islands, Barbuda, Bermuda, British Honduras, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Leeward Islands, Redonda, Turks and Caicos Islands, Windward Islands and West Indies (so stated));<br><br>Asia and Oceania — Ceylon, Cyprus (see note after Europe below), Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Pakistan (as constituted in 1971), Singapore and other countries in Asia and Oceania (including Brunei and all Commonwealth islands in the Pacific, not elsewhere mentioned);<br><br>Europe Gibraltar, Malta and Gozo. (in the Household Composition tables Cyprus was included in Europe New Commonwealth.)<br>The following terms are also used to describe sub-divisions of the New Commonwealth:<br>Far East - Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and all Commonwealth Islands in the Pacific not elsewhere classified;<br>West Indies — Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago. Note that Commonwealth birthplaces in unspecified parts of the Caribbean (including West Indies (so stated)) have been included under other and unspecified New Commonwealth countries in America. (In the Advance Analysis the term West Indies included all New Commonwealth countries in the Americas.)<br>Foreign countries are all countries outside the United Kingdom (as defined above), Irish<br>Republic (including Ireland (part not stated)), Old Commonwealth and New Commonwealth.<br>European Economic Community: it was not possible to distinguish between the German Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic. The term EEC or European Economic Community is therefore used for the Community as at census date but including the whole of Germany, (that is Belgium, France, Germany (GF R and GDR), Italy, Luxembourg and The Netherlands).</p>
                    <h2 id="COMEST_1971">Communal establishment</h2><p>In addition to the persons in households people were enumerated in a variety of nonprivate establishments (equivalent to non-private households) such as hotels, boarding houses, hospitals, mental homes, homes for old people, children’s homes, boarding schools, prisons, armed forces establishments, ships, hostels, religious communities and the like. <br><br>Generally the distinguishing characteristic is some form of communal catering and households enumerated on H forms with whom there were five or more boarders (or patients, foster children, lodgers or non-domestic employees) on census night were notcounted as households but counted under the appropriate class of non-private establishments.</p>
                    <h2 id="DEPCHHH_1971">Dependent children in household</h2><p>Dependent children: are ddldren in families who are either: (a) under 15 years of age. or <br><br>(b) under 25 years of age and classified as student (that is, if present at address of enumeralion on census night answering to question B8 on the household form, or if absent having ‘Student' entered in reply to question C4 which asked for particulars of the job held in the week before Census for absent persons).  <br><br>A household (equivalent to the term private household used in recent censuses) is either one person living alone, or a group of persons (who may or may not be related) living at the same address with common housekeeping. Persons staying temporarily with the household are included. A boarder having at least one meal a day with the household counts as a member of the household (breakfast counts as a meal for this purpose); but a lodger taking no meals with the main household counts as a separate one-person household, even if he shares kitchen and bathroom. A group of unrelated persons sharing a house or flat would count as one or as several households according to whether they maintained common housekeeping or provided their own meals separately. It was the enumerator’s responsibility to ascertain how many households were present at a given address and to obtain a completed household form from each: his conclusions were not amended in the Census Offices except that in the case of more than one household sharing a single room or sharing a caravan such households were amalgamated to form a single household.  </p>
                    <h2 id="DWELHHO_1971">Dwelling/Household occupancy</h2><p> An occupied dwelling is either a dwelling in which at least one household was enumerated <br><br>on census night or a dwelling in which at least one household usually, or occasionally, lived, although absent on census night. <br><br>A vacant dwelling is a dwelling which the enumerator recorded as having no household enumerated there on census night, and is neither the usual residence of any absent household, nor is it a dwelling which while not being the usual residence of any household is occupied occasionally by a household. <br><br>A vacant household space (other than a vacant dwelling) is the vacant accommodation in a shared occupied dwelling A shared dwelling can consist of occupied household space (in the same sense as when applied to dwelling) and vacant household space. <br><br>A household (equivalent to the term private household used in recent censuses) is either one person living alone, or a group of persons (who may or may not be related) living at the same address with common housekeeping. Persons staying temporarily with the household are included. A boarder having at least one meal a day with the household counts as a member of the household (breakfast counts as a meal for this purpose); but a lodger taking no meals with the main household counts as a separate one-person household, even if he shares kitchen and bathroom. A group of unrelated persons sharing a house or flat would count as one or as several households according to whether they maintained common housekeeping or provided their own meals separately. It was the enumerator’s responsibility to ascertain how many households were present at a given address and to obtain a completed household form from each: his conclusions were not amended in the Census Offices except that in the case of more than one household sharing a single room or sharing a caravan such households were amalgamated to form a single household. </p>
                    <h2 id="DWELHHT_1971">Dwelling/Household type</h2><p>>Household type: households are classified by type according to the answers given for individual members to question B5 on the household form (question 5 on the personal form), or to the corresponding question C1b for absent persons who were usually resident at the address. <br>(B5) Write ‘HEAD’ for the head of the household and relationship to the head for each of the other persons: for example ‘wife’, ‘son’, ‘daughter-in-law’, ‘visitor’, ‘boarder’, ‘paying guest‘. <br>Each person in the household was given a two-digit code. The first digit of the code gave the relationship to the head of the household either of that person or of the head of that person’s family and the second digit identified each family in the household separately. <br>In coding relationships, in-law, step and adopted relationships were treated as blood relationships but foster relationships were not. Thus ‘son-in-law’, ‘adopted son’ and ‘stepson’ were treated as equivalent to ‘son’, but ‘foster-son’ was treated as ‘unrelated’.

Details of persons in these categories are given in Tables 13, 14 and 15 of the Household Composition Report.

There was no question on this subject in the census but the following rules were developed for selecting the housewife for each household. <br><br>(a) If the head of the household is female she is the housewife. <br>(b) If the head of the household is a married man, his wife is the housewife. <br>(c) If the head of the household is a single, widowed or divorced man, or a married man whose wife is not shown as a member of the household then <br>(i) if there are no females aged 20 or over in the household the head himself is the housewife or <br>(ii) if there are females aged 20 or over in the household the eldest related member is housewife and if none are related then the eldest female is housewife. <br><br>These rules were developed in consultation with interested Government Departments, the Royal Statistical Society, the Market Research Society and the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. <br><br>The number of earners in a household or family is the number, of economically active persons in the household or family. <br><br>Density of occupation: this is as defined in 2.3 (p 16) except that for the Household Composition tables the dejure size of household was used as the numerator of the ratio.<br></p>

Housewives and persons engaged on home duties are classified as retired or housewife according to how they were described in the census form; <br>(b) Students in educational establishments: that is persons who either answered ‘Yes’ to question B8 on the census form or gave ‘Studying’ as a reason for not seeking work in question B7. A person was counted as a student if he would be attending full-time at an educational establishment during the term starting in April or May 1971. (Establishments provided by employers for training workers, such as apprenticeship schools, did not count as educational establishments.) Persons answering ‘Yes’ to question B8 were treated as students even if they had a job in the week before census, but persons with a job on day release did not count as students; <br>(c) Permanently sick: that is those who stated in reply to question B7 that they were not seeking work because of permanent sickness or disability; <br>(d) Others economically inactive: that is those persons never in employment or not seeking it. This group includes persons of independent means, housewives and others engaged on unpaid domestic duties, and by convention, trainees in Government training centres and au pair girls. Persons who failed to answer the economic activity questions, and those usually resident at their address of enumeration who gave ‘Inmate’, or a similar term as a reason for not seeking work in answer to question B7, are also included. <br>People aged 55 and over who were described on the census forms as ‘Students’ were re-classified as others economically inactive; so were people under the age of 35 who were described as ‘Retired‘.<br> <br>All people aged 15 and over not in the inactive category are in the category of economically active persons; they are sub-divided between those who are in employment and those who are out of employment. <br>Persons in employment during the week ended 24 April 1971 are those who had a job or worked for pay or profit at any time during the week, including work on own account, part-time work, casual or temporary work and unpaid work in a family business (other unpaid work does not count as employment). Persons temporarily away from work during the week because of holiday, sickness or injury, industrial dispute or temporary lay-off count as in employment if their job is waiting for them on their return. Thus in employment is intended to cover those who had ‘a job’ in the contractual sense irrespective of whether they were actually at work in the week before census, and all others who did work for pay or profit in that week. <br><br>Economically active persons out of employment throughout the week ended 24 April 1971 comprise two categories: <br>(i) Out of employment — sick, that is those persons who were out of work throughout the week and were prevented by temporary sickness or injury from seeking work, and <br>(ii) Out of employment — other, that is those persons who throughout the week were seeking work or waiting to take up a job already obtained. Persons giving ‘Inmate‘, or a similar term as a reason for not seeking work in answer to question B7 are also included, if they were not usually resident at the address at which they were enumerated (see 2.1 (p6) for concept of usual residence of inmates). <br></p>

                    <h2 id="HHCOMP_1971">Household composition</h2><p>Population covered <br>The statistics in the Household Composition tables are based on the ten per cent sample and refer to the characteristics of households and of persons usually resident in those households at the time of the census. Most of the tables cover usually resident households (see also 2.1 (p 6)). These are: <br><br>(a) enumerated households with at least one person normally resident at the address of enumeration (note: the usually resident person(s) need not have been present on census night) and <br>(b) absent households who returned forms with parts A and C only completed. <br><br>Chapter 2.1 (p 10) gives details of the relationship between de jure and enumerated households. Note that the population covered by the Household Composition tables should not be confused with that covered by the Usual Residence tables which give analyses of all enumerated persons according to their usual address as given on the census form for their place of enumeration. <br><br>The (de jure) size of a household used in the tables analysing household composition is the number of persons in the household whose usual address was given as the household address in reply to question B4 on the household form (or question 4 on the personal returns from private households), together with persons who usually lived with the household but who were absent on census night (and who were thus entered in part C of the household form). Resident domestic servants and members of resident domestic servants’ families are excluded from the count of persons in a usually resident household. <br>Households with no known residents are households in which either (a) every person listed on the census form was stated to be usually resident at an address different from the address of enumeration, or (b) all persons usually resident were resident domestic servants or members of their families. An example of the former type is a household which was enumerated while on holiday in temporarily rented accommodation. <br></p>
                    <h2 id="HHPP_1971">Number of persons in the household</h2><p>This variable records the number of persons in the household.<br>A household (equivalent to the term private household used in recent censuses) is either one person living alone, or a group of persons (who may or may not be related) living at the same address with common housekeeping. Persons staying temporarily with the household are included. A boarder having at least one meal a day with the household counts as a member of the household (breakfast counts as a meal for this purpose); but a lodger taking no meals with the main household counts as a separate one-person household, even if he shares kitchen and bathroom. A group of unrelated persons sharing a house or flat would count as one or as several households according to whether they maintained common housekeeping or provided their own meals separately. It was the enumerator’s responsibility to ascertain how many households were present at a given address and to obtain a completed household form from each: his conclusions were not amended in the Census Offices except that in the case of more than one household<br>sharing a single room or sharing a caravan such households were amalgamated to form a single household.<br>An enumerated household is a household containing at least one enumerated person, that<br>is with at least one person present on census night, irrespective of whether that person usually lives at the address of enumeration.<br>An absent household is a household usually resident at an address at which there was no person present on census night. Information about absent households was obtained by the enumerators for addresses for which no return was made and from census forms of which only part A or parts A and C were completed.</p>
                    <h2 id="HHRMS_1971">Number of rooms in the household</h2><p>The size of a dwelling or household space is the number of rooms in a dwelling or house <br>hold space and is derived from the answers given to question A3 on the household forms. The question was <br><br>A3 <br>How many rooms are there in your household’s accommodation? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . <br><br>Do not count small kitchens less than 6 ft wide, bathrooms and toilets, sculleries not used for cooking, closets, pantries and storerooms, landings, halls, lobbies or recesses, offices or shops used solely for business purposes. <br><br>Note A large room divided by a sliding or fixed partition should be counted as two rooms. <br>A room divided by curtains or portable screens should be counted as one room. <br>A vacant room-is a room in a vacant household space. <br><br>Notes on the rooms counted in previous censuses are given in 3.3. These show that the rooms counted in 1971 included the same types as in the 1966 Sample Census with the exclusion only of small kitchens, but in 1961 kitchens were counted only if they were used regularly for meals, or as living rooms or bedrooms. <br>The enumerators recorded on the household form the rooms shared between households as the appropriate fraction of a room (that is the number of shared rooms divided by the number of sharing households) for each of the sharing households; this ensured that the count of the total number of rooms in a shared dwelling could be correctly decided. However, in tabulating the number of rooms in household spaces, fractions of a room could not be used easily and the shared rooms were re-allocated to household spaces in the following manner. The number of shared rooms was subtracted from the answer to question A3 and the fractions of the shared rooms added on to give the actual number of rooms occupied by the households; this number could contain a fraction, but the sum of the number of rooms in every household in a dwelling still remained equal to the correct total of rooms in that dwelling. The fractional counts of rooms were then adjusted by rounding some numbers up and others down so as to maintain the correct total of rooms in the dwelling. Whether a number was rounded up or down depended on its position in the list of sharing households recorded in the enumerator’s record book, those at the beginning of the list being rounded up and those at the end being rounded down. <br><br><br></p>
                    <h2 id="HHSHDWEL_1971">Households in shared dwellings</h2></p>Those households who share rooms (other than toilets or bathrooms) and/or access space, part or the whole of which is used by at least one of the households to move between the rooms in their household space.</p>
                    <h2 id="HOURS_1971">Hours worked</h2></p>Population covered <br>All the tables relating to economic activity except table 18 in the County Reports and table 1 in Part 1 of the Economic Activity Volume are based on an analysis of the ten per cent sample of census returns. The two exceptions, which cover the enumerated population aged 15 and over, are based on 100 per cent of the census returns. <br><br>The statistics in the tables based on the ten per cent sample refer to people aged 15 and over enumerated in Great Britain who either: <br>(a) were usually resident in Great Britain, or <br>(b) had a place of work in Great Britain although usually resident in another country. <br><br>Further details concerning the population covered in the census and the concept of usual residence are given in 2.1. <br><br>In these tables the following classifications, relating to economic activity, are used: <br>(a) economic position <br>(b) occupation <br>(c) industry <br>(d) employment status <br>(e) type of earner, salary or wage <br>(f) social classes <br>(g) socio-economic groups and socio-economic classes <br>(h) hours worked <br>(i) workplace <br><br>In general, tabulations relating to economic position include the whole population aged <br>15 and over, those relating to social class or socio-economic group and class include the economically active and retired, and those relating to occupation include the economically active, where a geographical breakdown is given it refers to areas of usual residence. Tabulations relating to industry and hours worked normally include persons in employment and where a geographical breakdown is given it refers to areas of workplace. ln cross <br>tabulations of industry and hours worked by occupation, by social class or by socio-economic class only persons in employment are included and areas of workplace are used. In certain tables only sub-sets of these populations are included and where this is so it is made clear in the table headings. <br><br>The following tables do not conform to these general rules: <br>(a) Table 22 (Economic Activity Volume, Part III): Occupation one year before census by occupation at census, and sex, includes only persons in employment. <br>(b) Table 34 (Economic Activity Volume, Part IV): Industry by salary/wage earner groups and sex, includes all persons in employment except the armed forces and the self employed. <br>(c) Table 37 (Economic Activity Volume, Part V) and table 4 (Economic Activity County Leaflets, New Towns Volume and Sub-Regional Volume): Males by area of usual residence and socio-economic class, include only economically active males. <br>(d) Table 2 (Economic Activity County Leaflets, New Towns Volume and Sub-Regional <br>Volume) includes only persons in employment, who are analysed by area of workplace. <br>(e) Table 1 (Economic Activity Volume, Part I), table 18 (County Reports) and tables 1 and 2 (Advance Analysis) are analyses by areas of enumeration. <br>In some published tables thresholds have been applied, that is details are only tabulated for groups above a certain size; whenever this has been done details are given below the <br>table heading and unthresholded unpublished versions of the table are available showing all groups. <br><br>Hours worked <br>These are derived from the answers to question B19 on the household form, and question 19 on the personal return form, asked in respect of persons who had a job in the week before the census. Question B19 was <br><br>B19<br>How many hours per week does the person usually work in this job? Exclude overtime and meal breaks. <br><br>The hours worked of members of the armed forces were not asked for in the census, and appear as not stated in all relevant tables. <br><br></p>
                    <h2 id="INDUS_1971">Industry</h2></p>The allocation of an employed person to an industry is based on the answer to question B15 on the census form. The question, to be answered in respect of the main employment for persons who had a job in the week before the Census or for their most recent job if they were retired or out of work, was as follows:<br>What was the name and business of the person’s employer (if self-employed, the name and nature of the person’s business)? Give the trading name if one was used.<br>The following note was given with this question.<br>Describe the business fully and try to avoid abbreviations or initials. General terms such as ‘manufacturer’, ‘merchant’, ‘agent’, ‘broker’, ‘factor’, ‘dealer’, ‘engineering’, are not enough by themselves and further details should be given about the articles manufactured or dealt in.<br>For civil servants, local government officers and other public officials give the name of the Government department, local authority or public body and the branch in which they are employed.<br>For people employed solely in private domestic service write ‘PRIVATE’ in answer to this question.<br>For members of Armed Forces give arm and branch of service.</p>
                    <h2 id="LOCWRK_1971">Location of work</h2></p>Workplace was asked in respect of all person who had a job in the week before the census. The question (B20) was:<br>What is the full address of the person’s place of work? If the work is carried on mainly at home write ‘AT HOME’.<br>This was supplemented by the note:<br>Place of work<br>For people who do not work regularly at one place or who travel during the course of their work (for example, sales representatives, seamen and some building and transport workers):<br>(a) if they report daily to a depot or other fixed address give that address: (b) if they do not report daily to a fixed address write ‘NO FIXED PLACE’.<br>For people such as building workers employed on a site for a long period give the address of the site.<br>For dock workers give the name and address of the dock or wharf at which they are usually employed. <br>Persons whose workplace was returned as outside the United Kingdom are included in the analyses of workplace in the Economic Activity tables by treating their usual residence as their workplace. This was also done for persons whose workplace was returned as Northern Ireland although these are not specifically identified in the tables.</p>
                    <h2 id="MARSTA_1971">Marital status</h2><p>Marital condition was obtained from the answers to question B6 on the household form or question 6 on the personal 'form. The question (86) was<br>Write ‘single’, ‘married’, ‘widowed’ or ‘divorced' as appropriate.<br>If separated and not divorced write ‘married’.<br>It gives the marital condition at census day. Single persons are persons who have never married (that is spinsters and bachelors). Married persons include those who were separated but not divorced. Widowed persons are those who have not remarried since their spouse died. Divorced persons are those who have not remarried after divorce.</p>
                    <h2 id="MCHDU5_1971">May or may not have children under 5</h2><p>This variable records whether the person or household has children under 5 years old. </p>
                    <h2 id="MIG_1971">Migration</h2><p>The census concept of a migrant is based on the statements made in answer to questions B4, B11 and B12 on the household form and 4, 11 and 12 on the personal form concerning the person’s usual address at the time of the 1971 Census, on 25 April 1970 and 25 April 1966.<br>Questions B4 asked if the address of enumeration was the same as the person’s usual address and, if it was not, for the latter to be stated.<br>Question Bl I asked for the person's usual address one year before the census if it was different from the usual address on census day.<br>Question B12 asked for the person’s usual address five years before the census if it was different to the address one year before the census.<br>A migrant within one year preceding census is a person whose usual address on 25 April 1970 was different to his usual address at the date of the census.<br>A migrant within five years preceding census is a person whose usual address on 25 April 1966 was different to his usual address at the date of the census.<br>The statistics in the Migration tables are based on the ten per cent sample of census forms and refer only to those persons classified as migrants. . It should be noted that the form of the definition entails that the following categories of persons moving residence in the year or five years preceding the census are excluded from the count of migrants:<br>(a) children born after 25 April 1970 (see definition of wholly moving family, p 26)<br>(b) children born after 25 April 1966 but before 25 April 1970 in tables showing five year migrants (see definition of wholly moving family, p 26)<br>(c) persons who had emigrated overseas or had died before the census<br>(d) persons who were absent from home on census night and were not enumerated elsewhere in Great Britain.<br>In addition the intermediate moves of persons making several successive moves have not been counted. A person’s move has been tabulated as a migration from his usual address one or five years ago direct to his usual address at census date.</p>
                    <h2 id="MOTTWRK_1971">Mode of travel to work</h2><p>This variable records the method of travel to work of people aged 15 and over. The following classification of means of transport was used:<br>Train (including LT Tube);<br>Bus (private as well as public);<br>Car (including van);<br>Motor Cycle (including motor cycle combination); Pedal Cycle;<br>On foot and none (including people stating ‘None’ but whose usual address was different from address of workplace);<br>Other (including people who lived and worked at same address); Public transport (so described); Not stated.<br>When more than one means of transport was given on the census form the one highest on the above list was taken, for example: car and train, train taken.</p>
                    <h2 id="NRESVIS_1971">Normal residence of visitor</h2><p>This variable records the usual residence of visitors. Visitors to an area are those persons enumerated in the area whose usual address lies outside the area.     </p>
                    <h2 id="NUMDEPCH_1971">Number of dependent children</h2><p>This variable records the number of dependent children within a household. Dependent children: are ddldren in families who are either: (a) under 15 years of age. or <br><br>(b) under 25 years of age and classified as student (that is, if present at address of enumeralion on census night answering to question B8 on the household form, or if absent having ‘Student' entered in reply to question C4 which asked for particulars of the job held in the week before Census for absent persons).  <br><br>A household (equivalent to the term private household used in recent censuses) is either one person living alone, or a group of persons (who may or may not be related) living at the same address with common housekeeping. Persons staying temporarily with the household are included. A boarder having at least one meal a day with the household counts as a member of the household (breakfast counts as a meal for this purpose); but a lodger taking no meals with the main household counts as a separate one-person household, even if he shares kitchen and bathroom.

                    <h2 id="NUMRMS_1971">Number of rooms</h2><p>This variable records the number of rooms within a house. The number of rooms in hotels and boarding houses is the number of rooms used by guests or staff and their families for living, eating or sleeping but does not include storerooms, offices, kitchens, bathrooms or closets. The size of a dwelling or household space is the number of rooms in a dwelling or household space and is derived from the answers given to question A3 on the household forms. The question was<br>A3 How many rooms are there in your household’s accommodation? . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br>Do not count<br>Small kitchens less than 6 ft wide, bathrooms and toilets, sculleries not used for<br>cooking, closets, pantries and storerooms, landings, halls, lobbies or recesses, offices or shops used solely for business purposes.<br>Note A large room divided by a sliding or fixed partition should be counted as two rooms.<br>A room divided by curtains or portable screens should be counted as one room.<br>A vacant room-is a room in a vacant household space.</td></tr>

In particular the enumerated population includes people who usually lived elsewhere, including abroad, but who were temporarily staying in the area on census night. Persons away from their usual residence on night work and persons who had travelled overnight were enumerated at the address of the household or non-private establishment which they joined on 26 April provided they had not been recorded as present on a census form elsewhere. Members of the armed forces and mercantile marine outside Great Britain on census night were excluded. Members of foreign or Commonwealth armed forces were included if present in the country on census night, but foreign and Commonwealth naval vessels, and the people on board them, were not enumerated.</p>
                    <h2 id="PPABS_1971">Persons present or absent</h2><p>This variable records whether the person was present or absent on census night. ‘Present’ are the persons who were present in the area they are normally resident in on census night and ‘absent’ are the persons who were not present in the area they are normally resident in on census night.</p>
                    <h2 id="PPPRM_1971">Persons per room</h2><p>The density of occupation is the ratio of the number of persons in a household to the number of rooms in that household’s accommodation. (For the Housing tables the number of persons in a household is the number of enumerated persons. However in the Household Composition tables the number of persons in the usually resident household is used to define the density of occupation.) The following classification of density is used:<br>Over 1.5 persons per room<br>Over 1 and up to 1.5 persons per room<br>Over 0.75 and up to 1 person per room<br>0.5 and over and up to 0.75, person per room <br>Less than 0.5 person per room.</p>

In the last resort, a resident under 15 years of age was taken as head. No head was identified for households with no persons usually resident at the address or households consisting entirely of domestic servants. <br><br></p>
                    <h2 id="SEX_1971">Sex</h2><p>This variable records the sex of the person as female or male.</p>
                    <h2 id="STUSTA_1971">Student status</h2><p>a full time student is a person assigned to the category ‘student in an educational establishment’ in the classification of economic position. That is persons who either answered ‘Yes’ to question 88 on the census form or gave ‘Studying’ as a reason for not seeking work in question B7. A person was counted as a student if he would be attending full-time at an educational establishment during the term starting in April or May 1971. (Establishments provided by employers for training workers, such as apprenticeship schools, did not count as educational establishments.) Persons answering ‘Yes’ to question B8 were treated as students even if they had a job in the week be fore census, but persons with a job on day release did not count as students;</p>
                    <h2 id="TENU_1971">Tenure</h2><p>The tenure of a household was obtained from the answers to question Al on the household form. The question was A1<br><br>How do you and your household occupy your accommodation?<br>l  As an owner occupier (including purchase by mortgagc)<br>2 By renting it from the Council, New Town, or SSHA<br>3 As an unfurnished letting from a private landlord or company <br>4  As a furnished letting<br>5 In some other way (Please give details, including whether furnished or unfurnished)<br>Note: if the accommodation is occupied by lease originally granted for more than 31 years, tick ‘owner occupier’.<br>The five categories of tenure given in the tables are: <br>(i) Owner occupier;<br>(ii) Rented from a Council or New Town;<br>(iii) Rented furnished;<br>(iv) Rented unfurnished from a private landlord; <br>(v) Not stated;<br>and the first four of these correspond to the first four boxes of the question. Where the fifth box was ticked and the householder answered by giving details of his tenure, the information was classified into one of these four categories. Tenure from a housing association was treated as renting unfurnished from a private landlord. Renting with a farm, shop or other business premises, and tenure by virtue of employment were both classified as renting unfurnished from a private landlord unless furnished tenure was specified when the tenure was treated as rented furnished. <br>Statements of ‘rent-free’ tenure from a relative, employer, previous employer, charitable organisation or from the Crown were similarly coded as rented unfurnished from a private landlord unless stated to be furnished. Leasehold tenure was counted as owner occupation if the lease was originally granted for, or since extended to, more than 21 years; otherwise it was treated as unfurnished tenancy.<br>The tenure of a dwelling was taken to be that of the lowest numerical code (see above list) allocated to any of the households in that dwelling.</p>
                    <h2 id="TWOPHH_1971">Two-person households</h2><p>The variable records the number of two-person households per 1000 private households present, it contains 3 categories, these are:<br><br>All households	<br>	1 pensionable person	<br>	2 pensionable persons</p>
                    <h2 id="UNIT_1971">Unit</h2><p>The unit of measurement for the particular count.</p>
                    <h2 id="URESPOP_1971">Usual resident population</h2><p>The usual residence of enumerated persons was obtained from the answers to question B4 on the household form, or question 4 on the personal form, which asked for the usual address of persons present on census night. If this was the same as the address of enumeration, the instruction was to write ‘Here’; otherwise to give the usual address. Boarders were to be counted usually resident at the address of enumeration if they considered this was their usual address. For students and children away from home during term time the home address was to be given as their usual address. The usual address for persons for whom no answer was given, or for whom the answer was ‘None’, was taken as the place of enumeration.</p>
                    <h2 id="VISPRES_1971">Visitors present</h2><p>This variable records the number of visitors present on census day per 1000 persons present. Visitors to an area are those persons enumerated in the area whose usual address lies outside the area.</p>
