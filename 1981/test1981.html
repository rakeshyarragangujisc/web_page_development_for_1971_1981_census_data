                    <h2 id="ACCESS_1981">Access</h2><p>Means of access to household’s accommodation<br><br>66.(b) <br>Means of access relates to the main entrance to the living accommodation. Alternative entrances, eg<br>via basement or back door, were not coded:<br><br>(f) Means of access to household's accommodation<br><br>1. No lift; no external or internal stair (with 6 or more steps) for access<br><br>2. External stair or outside steps (with 6 or more steps) for access<br><br>3. Internal stair (with 6 or more steps) for access<br><br>4. Lift<br><br>Enumerators were asked to:<br>"Code the way in which members of a household get to their accommodation from ground or street level.<br><br>Where there is no living accommodation on the same level as the main entrance door to a dwelling,<br>include a stair etc (provided there are at least 6 steps) which must be negotiated in order to reach<br>the living accommodation. The upper flat in a block of 4 flats often has this arrangement: immediately<br>the front door is opened, you are confronted with a flight of steps to the living area.<br><br>An external stair is one that is open to the elements.<br><br>Where there is a path as an alternative to a flight of garden steps , disregard the steps (since members of<br>the household can use the path instead of the steps).<br><br>Include a lift even if it is not working.<br><br>Where a lift is available, there will also be a stair; in such cases therefore box 2 and/or 3 should also be ticked.<br><br>Disregard a stair (or steps) which it is not necessary to negotiate in order to gain access to a particular<br>household’s accommodation, eg in the ground floor flats in a tenement, the internal stair would not be included."<br><br>Where the household space was not occupied on census night, the enumerator noted the information for the accommodation,<br>(recorded in the enumerator’s panel for private households) on a form D together with an estimate of <br>the number of rooms. This form was also used to record the status of the property on census night (vacant etc).</p>
                        <h2 id="ACCTYP_1981">Accommodation Type</h2><p>Household accommodation<br><br>Information about the type of accommodation occupied by a household was noted by the enumerator in a panel on the front of the household form while the householder was asked to record, at question 19, information about the sharing of access to the accommodation with other households.<br>Enumerators were given a programmed learning booklet to cover the main aspects of the classification of the building in which the household’s accommodation was situated.</p>
                        <h2 id="AGE_1981">Age</h2><p>Age has been derived from date of birth and is the completed years of age at census date, unless specified<br>otherwise in a table. Pensionable age is the minimum age at which a person may receive a national insurance retirement pension - 60 for women and 65 for men.</p>
                        <h2 id="AMENIT_1981">Amenities</h2><p>Question H3, Amenities: the exclusive use or otherwise of an inside flush toilet (WC) and a fixed bath or shower <br>(referred to as “a bath" in the classification in para 45). The question took the following form:<br><br>H3 Amenities<br>Has your household the use of the following amenities on these premises? Please tick the appropriate boxes.<br><br>- A fixed bath or shower permanently connected to a water supply and a waste pipe<br>1. YES - for use only by this household<br>2. YES - for use also by another household<br>3. NO fixed bath or shower<br><br>- A flush toilet (WC) with entrance inside the building<br>1. YES - for use only by this household<br>2. YES - for use also by another household<br>3. NO inside flush toilet (WC)<br><br>- A flush toilet (WC) with entrance outside the building<br>1. YES - for use only by this household<br>2. YES - for use also by another household<br>3. NO outside flush toilet (WC)</p>
                        <h2 id="BIRTHPL_1981">Birthplace</h2><p>Classification of country of birth<br><br>The British Isles consists of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and United Kingdom - part not stated), Channel Isles, Isle of Man, Irish Republic and Ireland (part not stated); each of these areas can be separately identified. In some tables, for example, in the small<br>area statistics, the United Kingdom is taken to include the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man, though these areas are not formally part of the United Kingdom. <br>Irish Republic has been taken to include responses written in under box 6 as ‘Ireland’, except in tables where Ireland (part not stated) is shown separately.</p>
                        <h2 id="BIRTHPLHH_1981">Birthplace of household head</h2><p>Classification of country of birth<br><br>The British Isles consists of the United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and United Kingdom - part not stated), Channel Isles, Isle of Man, Irish Republic and Ireland (part not stated); each of these areas can be separately identified. In some tables, for example, in the small<br>area statistics, the United Kingdom is taken to include the Channel Isles and the Isle of Man, though these areas are not formally part of the United Kingdom. <br>Irish Republic has been taken to include responses written in under box 6 as ‘Ireland’, except in tables where Ireland (part not stated) is shown separately.<br><br>Head of household (sample processing) has been regarded as the person entered in the first column of the census form provided that person was:<br><br>a. aged 16 years or over, and<br>b. usually resident at This address.<br><br>If one of these conditions was not met, the first person aged 16 years or over to be entered on the form and recorded as usually resident at "This address", who was not a domestic servant was classified as the head. In the last resort the oldest resident under 16 years of age would be taken as<br>head. No head was identified in those households consisting entirely of visitors or domestic servants. <br>This definition differs from the corresponding definition in para 85 because of the additional ruling concerning domestic servants.</p>
                        <h2 id="BUITYPE_1981">Building Type</h2><p>Type of building<br>Section (d) of the enumerator’s panel was used to record type of building:<br><br>(d) Type of building in which household's accommodation is situated — tick only one box<br><br>House that is:<br>1. Detached<br>2. Semi-detached<br>3. Terraced (including end of terrace)<br><br>Flat or rooms in a building with:<br>4. 2 storeys<br>5. 3 or 4 storeys<br>6. 5 Storeys or over<br>7. A single flat with a shop, office or other business<br><br>Non-permanent structure:<br>8. Caravan<br>9. Other non-permanent structure<br><br>The enumerators also had the following notes:<br><br>House - separated from neighbouring accommodation only by a vertical division, or standing on its own. Codes 1, 2 or 3.<br><br>Flat - separated from neighbouring accommodation by a horizontal division. Codes 4, 5, 6 or 7.<br><br>Categories<br><br>Houses - Code houses according to their relationship with any neighbouring buildings.<br>1. Detached<br>House standing on its own.<br><br>2. Semi-detached<br>Usually one of a pair of houses with a common internal dividing wall. A single house with one wall joined to a block of flats<br>or non-residential premises is included in this category.<br><br>3. Terraced (including end of terrace)<br><br>One of a row of 3 or more houses usually of similar design with 2 (one in the case of an end of terrace house) common internal dividing walls.<br><br>Flat or rooms<br><br>With the exception of category 7, code flats or rooms according to the number of storeys in the building which contains them.<br><br>A single flat with shop, office or other business<br><br>This category applies to a single flat in an otherwise non-residential building. If there is more than one flat in the building, code according to the number of storeys. <br><br>General notes on categories<br><br>Maisonette	In a maisonette, household accommodation is on more than one level and there is other accomodation (usually flats or maisonettes) above and/or below.<br><br>Changes in adjoining accommodation	If there has been a change of use (eg to hotel or non-residential, or conversion to flats) treat adjoining (unchanged) accommodation in the context of the original building. Thus, if one of pair of semi-detached houses has been divided into flats, code the flats according to the mumber of storeys; the code applicable to the unaltered house would remain unchanged as 2 (semi-detached).<br><br>Houses linked by garage or garden wall 	Disregard any such links in deciding building type.<br><br>Counting storeys<br><br>Count each level whether residential or not, including:<br><br>- basements<br>- attic conversions<br>- each level within a maisonette<br><br>but excluding:<br><br>- cellars</p>
                        <h2 id="CAROWN_1981">Cars</h2><p>Cars and vans<br>Statistics analysing households by the number of cars and vans available for use by household members were obtained from the answers to question H5:<br><br>H5 Cars and vans<br>Please tick the appropriate box to indicate the number of cars and vans normally available for use by you or members of your<br>household (other than visitors).<br><br>0 None <br>1 One <br>2 Two  <br>3 Three or more<br><br>Include any car or van provided by employers if normally available for use by you or members of your household but exclude vans used solely for the carriage of goods.<br><br>Counts of total numbers of cars assume exactly 3 for each entry in box 3, this assumption is unlikely to have led to a significant undercount of cars (probably less than 1 per cent).</p>
                        <h2 id="CHILDHOU_1981">Children in Household</h2><p>Dependent children (sample processing) are children in families who are<br><br>a. under 16 years of age, or<br><br>b. under 19 years of age, never-married and classified from the question on economic activity last week as a student.<br><br>This definition differs from the corresponding definition on paragraph 85 because the child must be part of a family and aged under 19 at b. (as opposed to under 25 in the definition used for the<br>full processing).<br><br>Non-dependent children (sample processing) are children in families who are never-married, aged 16 years or over and not classified as a student from the question on economic activity last week.<br><br>Household<br><br>A household is either one person living alone or a group of people (who may or may not be related) living, or staying temporarily, at the same address with common housekeeping. Enumerators were told to treat a group of people as a household if there was any regular arrangement to share at least one meal a day, breakfast counting as a meal, or if the occupants shared a common living or sitting room.</p>

                        <h2 id="COMEST_1981">Communal Establishments</h2><p>People were enumerated in a variety of communal establishments (also referred to as non-private establishments) such as hotels, boarding houses, hospitals, homes for old people, boarding schools, prisons, armed forces establishments, ships, hostels, religious communities and so on. In general the<br>distinguishing feature of a communal establishment is some form of communal catering. Households enumerated on H forms but found to contain five or more boarders, patients, foster children, lodgers or non-domestic employees on census night were re-classified at the processing stage to the appropriate<br>class of communal (or non-private) establishment. The population enumerated in communal establishments plus vagrants and campers is referred to as the population not in private households.</p>
                        <h2 id="COMESTR_1981">Communal establishment residents</h2><p>Communal establishments<br><br>Classification of communal (non-private) establishments<br><br>The 1981 categories of communal establishment comprise the following:-<br><br>(a) Hotels: Hotels, boarding houses, apartment houses, inns, holiday camps and other similar establishments providing board and accommodation for visitors.<br><br>Note: Establishments described as hotels or inns but with no sleeping accommodation for guests are excluded.<br><br>(b)* National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and homes<br><br>(i) Psychiatric +: Hospitals classified as such by the DHSS and the three Special Hospitals (Broadmoor, Rampton and Moss Side).<br><br>(ii) Other: All other NHS hospitals and homes.<br><br>(c)* Non-NHS hospitals and homes<br><br>(i) Psychiatric +: Mental hospitals or homes not administered under NHS; homes and hostels for the mentally disordered maintained by local authorities; mental after care units.<br><br>(ii) Other: All other non-NHS hospitals and homes including ‘households’ containing five or more patients.<br><br>*: Including staff homes and hostels, for example, for nurses, provided by the establishment, whether sited with the establishment or sited away from it.<br><br>+: The 1971 term Psychiatric has been retained in the table layouts, though this category consists of homes and hospitals for the mentally handicapped as well as the mentally ill.<br><br>(d) Homes for the old and the disabled: Residential accommodation for the old and/or disabled including accommodation made available in premises maintained by voluntary organisations, eg Cheshire Homes; homes for old and/or disabled persons, blind, deaf, etc, registered with local authority. Almshouses are included unless classified as private households.<br><br>(e) Children’s homes: Children’s homes and hostels including those provided by or maintained by voluntary organisations; List D schools in Scotland; ‘households’ with five or more foster children.<br><br>Note: Residential schools and homes for handicapped, educationally sub-normal and maladjusted children, maintained or assisted by education authorities, are included in educational establishments.<br><br>(f) Educational establishments: Residential schools, training colleges, theological colleges and university halls of residence and students’ hostels administered by schools, colleges and universities; residential schools and homes for handicapped, educationally sub-normal and maladjusted children maintained or assisted by education authorities; religious institutions which are boarding schools or which have living accommodation for teachers.<br><br>Note: Training schools provided exclusively for a single employer or for a trade association or government department are classified as miscellaneous communal establishments.<br><br>(g) Prison department establishments: Prisons, detention centres and borstals.<br><br>(h) Defence establishments, including naval vessels and service hospitals: Army and Air Force camps or establishments, naval shore stations and vessels manned by services personnel, Fleet<br>Auxiliary vessels, Service hospitals; hostels for NAAFI etc, personnel are included, even if located outside the grounds of a camp. Civilians in services establishments including NAAFI staff are included in the population of defence establishments.<br><br>Note: Married quarters for service personnel or civilians are excluded.<br><br>(i) Civilian Ships, Boats and Barges: As defined.<br><br>Note: Lightships come under miscellaneous and houseboats are treated as private households in non-permanent accommodation.<br><br>(j) Hostels and common lodging houses: Hostels, common lodging houses, reception centres with resident staff used by people as their main or only residence whether run by a statutory authority (eg local authority hostels) or religious institutions or other voluntary organisations (eg Church Army, Salvation Army, YMCA, YWCA) or private individuals or commercial organisations (eg Rowton Houses).<br><br>(k) Miscellaneous communal establishments: A heterogeneous group containing Youth Hostels, working men’s hostels, contractor camps, police section houses, homes for single women and their children, community homes, fire stations, lighthouses and light-ships, training centres and religious institutions not classified elsewhere.<br><br>The two major changes made to the 1971 Census classification are:<br><br>a. Hostels and common lodging houses form a separate category (previously included under Miscellaneous communal establishments).<br><br>b. Places of detention are restricted to prison department establishments ie. prisons, remand and detention centres and borstals. Community homes, remand homes and police stations containing a lock-up are now classified as Miscellaneous communal establishments.<br><br><br>Instructions for special types<br><br>Small hotels, guest houses containing ten rooms or more were treated as communal establishments. Where they contained less than ten rooms they were classified as communal establishments if there were present on census night any resident staff other than the proprietor and his family or five or more guests.<br><br>Sheltered housing, ie. accommodation provided for the elderly, handicapped etc, often fell between a communal establishment and a private household in that a main meal could be taken communally<br>though each person had his or her own separate accommodation with facilities for cooking. If at least half the people within the sheltered housing complex possessed facilities for cooking their own meals, they were treated as members of private households and, if less than half, as members of a communal establishment.<br><br>Itinerant caravan dwellers, for example, with circuses or fairs, were treated as private households.<br><br>Private residences in the grounds of an establishment, for example, a doctor’s house, a caretaker’s cottage or porter’s lodge, were treated as private households but families occupying flats or suites of rooms within the main building of an establishment were treated as part of the main establishment, ie. the persons living in this type of accommodation were listed on the L form and enumerated on I forms.<br><br>Service families or civilians living in married quarters of the Armed Services were enumerated as private households whether the quarters were located within or outside the boundaries of the service establishment.<br><br>Annexes to communal establishments were treated as part of the main establishment if located in the same enumeration district or if meals were taken at the main establishment though the annexe was in a different enumeration district. The annexe was treated as a separate establishment if located in a different ED and meals were provided at the annexe (breakfast counting as a meal) or there were facilities for self catering; but if there was no one in charge of the annexe to complete the L form and issue and collect I forms the annexe had to be treated as accommodation occupied by private households.<br><br>Residence classification and status in communal establishments<br><br>Residence classification: Persons enumerated in communal establishment groups (a) to (g) and (j) to (k) above, that is hotels, hospitals and homes, educational establishments, prison department<br>establishments, hostels and common lodging houses and miscellaneous communal establishments, were given one of three residence classification codes from answers to the question on position in<br>establishment and, for managers and staff, from answers to the question on usual address. The need to use answers to the question on usual address arose from a late decision related to the small area statistics. The classification comprises:<br><br>(i) 	Resident managers and staff<br>(ii)	Guests or inmates<br>(iii) 	Relatives of managers and staff and other persons (including managers and staff not usually resident at the establishment).<br><br>All persons in defence establishments and on civilian ships are classed together and, when necessary. are included with category (ii).<br><br>Status in establishment: This classification cross analyses the codes in the residence classification against answers to the question on usual address, as follows:<br><br>(i)	Resident managers and staff<br><br>(ii) 	Resident guests or inmates<br><br>(iii) 	Visiting guests<br><br>(iv) 	Resident relatives of managers and staff and other persons<br><br>(v) 	Visiting relatives of managers and staff and other persons (including managers and staff not usually resident at the establishment).<br><br>Note: Categories (i) in the two classifications are the same.</p>
                        <h2 id="DEPCHD_1981">Dependant Children</h2><p>Dependent children (sample processing) are children in families who are<br><br>a. under 16 years of age, or<br><br>b. under 19 years of age, never-married and classified from the question on economic activity last week as a student.<br><br>This definition differs from the corresponding definition on paragraph 85 because the child must be part of a family and aged under 19 at b. (as opposed to under 25 in the definition used for the<br>full processing).</p>
                        <h2 id="DEPCHILDHH_1981">Dependent children in household</h2><p>Number of dependenet children in household<br><br>Dependent child (full processing) is defined as a person:<br><br>a. under 16 years of age, or<br>b. under 25 years of age, never married and classified from the question on economic activity last week as a student. (This<br>definition appears in only one table in SAS and county reports).<br><br><br>Dependent children (sample processing) are children in families who are<br><br>a. under 16 years of age, or<br>b. under 19 years of age, never-married and classified from the question on economic activity last week as a student.<br><br>Household<br><br>A household is either one person living alone or a group of people (who may or may not be related) living, or staying temporarily, at the same address with common housekeeping. Enumerators were told to treat a group of people as a household if there was any regular arrangement to share at least one meal a day, breakfast counting as a meal, or if the occupants shared a common living or sitting room.</p>
                        <h2 id="ECOACT_1981">Economic Activity</h2><p>Economic activity<br><br>The economic activity tables describe the economic characteristics of the population. The characteristics include both those obtained directly from census questions - economic position, employment status, occupation, industry and workplace - and others derived from combining answers to these questions - social class and socio-economic group (from occupation and employment status) and socio-economic class (from social class and socio-economic group).<br><br>Economic position and employment status are included in the full processing while occupation, industry and workplace are part of the ten per cent sample.</p>
                        <h2 id="EMPSTA_1981">Employment Status</h2><p>The questions on employment status (Q 13), occupation (Q 12) and industry (Q 11) were required to be answered in respect of the main employment for persons who had a job in the week before the census (codes 1 or 2 in economic position) or in respect of the most recent full-time job, if any, for persons out of employment (codes 3, 4 and 5), permanently sick (code 6) or wholly retired from employment (code 8). The question on employment status was:<br><br>13. Employment status<br>Please tick the appropriate box.<br>Box 3 should be ticked for a person having management or supervisory responsibility for other employees. For a person employed as a quality control inspector and concerned only with the technical quality of a product tick box 2.<br><br>1. Apprentice or articled trainee<br>2. Employee not supervising other employees<br>3. Employee supervising other employee<br>4. Self-employed not employing others<br>5. Self-employed employing others<br><br>Additional notes: instructed members of the armed forces not to answer this question.</p>
                        <h2 id="FAMSTA_1981">Family Status</h2><p>A family consists of:<br><br>a.	a married couple with or without their never married child(ren),<br><br>or<br><br>b.	a father or mother together with his or her never married child(ren),<br><br>or<br><br>c.	grandparent(s) with grandchild(ren) if there are no apparent parents of the grandchild(ren) usually resident in the household.<br><br>In this definition there is no age limit to the term child. For example, a parent (or parents) with a never married child, say aged 40 years, would be classified as a family consisting of a lone parent (or married couple) with children. Type (a) is a married couple family and type (b) a lone parent family. Families of type (c) would be classified as a married couple family or lone parent family, as appropriate.</p>
                        <h2 id="FORIND_1981">Industry, former</h2><p>Industry<br><br>The industry in which a person is engaged is determined by the business or economic activity in which his or her occupation is followed. A single business may employ people of varying occupations to provide a particular service or to make a particular product. While the occupational classification takes account only of the nature of the work performed, the industrial classification has regard only to the nature of the service or product to which the labour contributes. For example, a carpenter would be classified industrially to building, if employed by a builder, but to brewing, if employed by a brewery firm.<br><br>The allocation of an employed person (codes 1 and 2 in the economic position question) to an industry was based on the answers to the following question:<br><br>11. Name and business of employer (If self-employed the name and natare of the person’s business)<br><br>a. Name of employer<br><br>Please give the name of the person's employer. Give the trading name if one is used and avoid using abbreviations or initials.<br>For members of the Armed Forces, civil serverants and local government officers see notes on back page before answering questions 11-15.<br><br>b.  Nature of business<br><br>Please describe what the employer for the person if self-employed) makes or does.<br>For a person employed in private domestic service write 'Domestic Service'.<br><br>Additional notes for this question were given in respect of members of the armed forces, civil servants and local government officers. Members of the armed forces were asked to write ‘Armed<br>Forces’ at 11a, and where a member of the armed forces of a country other than the UK, to add the name of the country. They were asked to leave 11b unanswered. Civil servants were asked to give the name of their department at 11a and to write ‘Government department’ at 11b. Local government officers and other public officials were asked to give the name of the local authority or<br>public body at 11a and the branch in which they were employed at 11b.<br><br>Note: While the question was addressed to the same ‘population’ as the question on employment status and occupation, the information on industry for those without a job was used solely in connection with occupational coding.<br><br>Industry codes were assigned, as far as possible, by reference to lists from the Department of Employment which gave names and addresses of employers by industry code. Where the employer’s name at ‘a’ of the question was not listed, a code was allocated from the information given at ‘a’ and 'b' of the question.<br><br>In the tables, industries are classified according to the Standard Industrial Classification, Revised 1980 (HMSO, 1979). The classification comprises the full range of activities divided into broad divisions each denoted by a single digit. The divisions are divided into classes each denoted by the addition of a second digit. The classes are split into groups (3 digits) and the groups into activity headings (by the addition of one digit to the group number). For example:<br><br>Division 4 Other manufacturing industries<br>Class (G(Group) Activity*<br>48 	Processing of rubber and plastics<br><br>	(481)1 Rubber tyres and inner tubes<br>	(481)2 Other rubber products<br>	(482)0 Retreading and specialist repairing of rubber tyres<br><br>*Activity is given by four digits ie 4811 = Rubber tyres and inner tubes.<br><br>The classification is made up of 10 divisions, 60 classes, 222 groups and 334 activity headings. In general the activity headings have been used in the coding. A summary of the classification used in the census is given at Appendix D of Classification of occupations, 1980.<br><br>The classification of some activities presents conceptual problems, for example, head offices which are located at a different location from the place where the main activities are carried out, or repair work carried out by the manufacturers or distributors of the goods concerned. Methods for dealing with such problems are set out in the introduction to the Standard Industrial Classification, Revised 1980.</p>
                        <h2 id="GLANGS_1981">Gaelic</h2><p>Scottish gaelic<br>The question on the Gaelic language was as follows:<br><br>Can the person speak, read or write Scottish Gaelic?<br>Please tick the appropriate box(es)<br><br>1 Can speak Gaelic<br>2 Can read Gaelic<br>3 Can write Gaelic<br>4 Does not know Gaelic<br><br>The question was included on all household and individual forms fielded in Scotland and was asked of all persons aged 3 or over.<br><br>A new form of the question has been asked that concentrates on the ability to speak, read or write Scottish Gaelic. The section of the 1971 question that asked Gaelic speakers if they could also speak English was dropped, because the small numbers involved who did not speak English could not be accurately measured from a census.</p>

                        <h2 id="HHDCOM_1981">Household Composition</h2><p>Household composition<br><br>The 1981 Census adopts two approaches to the analysis of household composition, both referring to private households with usual residents as the base, that is, restricted to persons whose usual addresses were entered as this address. The first uses only the answers to the questions on age,sex and marital status of each person in the household. The second method also uses the answers to the question on relationship in household.<br><br>Household composition from age, sex and marital status<br><br>Greater use than hitherto is being made of the analysis of household composition in terms of the age, sex and marital status of household members.

Limited guidance to the enumerator on whom to treat as usually living at this address for the purposes of completing an H form. This guidance was given at Appendix A of the Field Manual in England and Wales (not issued in Scotland). A copy of the Appendix is shown on page 7.<br><br>c. Leaflets (UA in England and Wales and UR in Scotland) distributed in communal establishments for the sick and disabled advising patients how to answer the question on usual address. A copy of UA is shown on page 8.<br><br>The following rules were laid down for inmates of prisons, borstals and detention centres. If a prisoner had served six months or more of a sentence in custody (not necessarily in the same prison or establishment) immediately prior to 5 April 1981, the usual address was taken to be this address. If the prisoner had served less than six months, the usual address before admission was to be given. A similar procedure was followed for children in community homes.<br><br>Where the question on usual address was not answered the auto-edit imputed a code of this address or elsewhere not stated. A reponse of “none” or "no fixed address” was coded to this address; but the record for such a person would be included in the processing only if the answer to the question on whereabouts was "here".<br><br>Persons who failed to answer the question or who stated " none” or "no fixed address" appear as part of the usually resident population (on either basis of measurement) in the area in which they were enumerated; but they are included as part of a private household with usual residents only if assigned a code of this address.</p>
                        <h2 id="HHSPAC_1981">Household Spaces</h2><p>The basic household space classification described in para 45. It replaced the earlier type of permanent buildings, used in the SAS, county census question on the sharing of ‘circulation’ space reports and housing volumes, is based on the (ie hall, passage, landing or staircase). In particular, following information on the nature of the census tests had shown that many households accommodation (Panel A) and sharing (H4), rooms occupying the top floor(s) of multi-occupied (H1) and amenities (H13)<br><br>Enumerators were given guidance on identifying caravans and other mobile or temporary (non-permanent) structures. While towable caravans, mobile homes, converted railway carriages and houseboats are treated as non-permanent structures, other structures such as huts and holiday chalets may be more difficult to classify between permanent and non-permanent. Thus enumerators were instructed to use the following rule:<br><br>"A permanent building is one which satisfies at least one of the following criteria:<br><br>— the walls are of brick, stone and mortar, concrete, breeze block or similar material.<br>— the roof is of tiles, slate, thatch, shingle or concrete.<br>— the length of the shortest wall is at least 15 feet.<br><br>Enumerators were told to regard a structure as non-permanent if none of the qualifications were met. Furthermore, enumerators were instructed to record non-permanent structures (boxes 20 and 30 in Panel A) only if the accommodation was occupied on census night or, if it was not occupied, only if it was the usual residence of a household.<br><br><br>Household space classification<br>(i) 	Purpose-built flats and maisonettes<br>(ii) 	Household spaces with separate entrance from outside the building<br>(iii) 	Household spaces with shared access from outside the building, self-contained accommodation comprising:<br><br>	(a) 	Two or more rooms and with the exclusive use of a bath and parts inside WC<br><br>	(b) 	One room and with the exclusive use of a bath and parts inside WC (flatlet)<br><br>	(c) 	Two or more rooms but without the exclusive use of a bath and/or inside WC<br><br>(iv) 	Accommodation not self-contained but comprising:<br><br>	(a) 	One room without the exclusive use of a bath and/or inside WC (bedsit)<br><br>	(b) 	Two or more rooms<br><br>* Answers to question H4 were not used in determining ‘self-containment' for household spaces of one room: tests prior to the census had shown that form-fillers in such accommodation had difficulty in selecting a box and the note to the question was included for guidance. A household space consisting of one room and with shared access from outside the building was taken to be self-contained if the household had the exclusive use of a bath and inside WC and not self-contained if the household shared, or did not have, either or both of these amenities.<br><br>Household<br><br>A household is either one person living alone or a group of people (who may or may not be related) living, or staying temporarily, at the same address with common housekeeping. Enumerators were told to treat a group of people as a household if there was any regular arrangement to share at least one meal a day, breakfast counting as a meal, or if the occupants shared a common living or sitting room.</p>

You may be asked questions where the form-filler is not sure whether or not to include somebody, or where names have been entered in Panel B of the H form. A list of all possible circumstances would be too long, but the following guidelines will help.<br><br>EVERYONE PRESENT ON CENSUS NIGHT MUST BE INCLUDED<br><br>Include anyone NOT PRESENT who is a:<br><br>Au pair<br>— on long-term engagement of a year or more <br><br>Child (parent completing form)<br>— at boarding school, university, college, etc, if not married<br>— adopted or foster-child (however temporary)<br><br>Merchant Seaman<br><br>Person in Institution<br>— has been in the institution for less than 6 months<br><br>Regular Visitor (eg elderly relative living here part of the year)<br>— if living here most of the year (6 months or more)<br><br>Shift or Night Worker<br><br>Spouse<br>— works away from home, abroad, in forces, etc<br><br>Exclude anyone NOT PRESENT who is a:<br><br>Boarder<br>— returns to another address at week-ends<br><br>Child (parent completing form)<br>— in the forces or working abroad<br><br>Person in Institution<br>— has been in the institution for 6 months or more<br><br>This sort of case can cause distress, so only offer it as a guide. For example, “We have a general rule that if he/she has been in hospital for 6 months or more he/she is regarded as living at the hospital, but it is really for you to decide.

Enumerators were told to treat a group of people as a household if there was any regular arrangement to share at least one meal a day, breakfast counting as a meal, or if the occupants shared a common living or sitting room.</p>
                        <h2 id="INDUST_1981">Industry</h2><p>Industry<br><br>The industry in which a person is engaged is determined by the business or economic activity in which his or her occupation is followed. A single business may employ people of varying occupations to provide a particular service or to make a particular product. While the occupational classification takes account only of the nature of the work performed, the industrial classification has regard only to the nature of the service or product to which the labour contributes. For example, a carpenter would be classified industrially to building, if employed by a builder, but to brewing, if employed by a brewery firm.<br><br>The allocation of an employed person (codes 1 and 2 in the economic position question) to an industry was based on the answers to the following question:<br><br>11. Name and business of employer (If self-employed the name and nature of the person’s business)<br><br>a. Name of employer<br><br>Please give the name of the person's employer. Give the trading name if one is used and avoid using abbreviations or initials.<br>For members of the Armed Forces, civil serverants and local government officers see notes on back page before answering questions 11-15.<br><br>b.  Nature of business<br><br>Please describe what the employer for the person if self-employed) makes or does.<br>For a person employed in private domestic service write 'Domestic Service'.<br><br>Additional notes for this question were given in respect of members of the armed forces, civil servants and local government officers. Members of the armed forces were asked to write ‘Armed Forces’ at 11a, and where a member of the armed forces of a country other than the UK, to add the name of the country. They were asked to leave 11b unanswered. Civil servants were asked to give the name of their department at 11a and to write ‘Government department’ at 11b. Local government officers and other public officials were asked to give the name of the local authority or public body at 11a and the branch in which they were employed at 11b.<br><br>Note: While the question was addressed to the same ‘population’ as the question on employment status and occupation, the information on industry for those without a job was used solely in connection with occupational coding.<br><br>Industry codes were assigned, as far as possible, by reference to lists from the Department of Employment which gave names and addresses of employers by industry code. Where the employer’s name at ‘a’ of the question was not listed, a code was allocated from the information given at ‘a’ and 'b' of the question.<br><br>In the tables, industries are classified according to the Standard Industrial Classification, Revised 1980 (HMSO, 1979). The classification comprises the full range of activities divided into broad divisions each denoted by a single digit. The divisions are divided into classes each denoted by the addition of a second digit. The classes are split into groups (3 digits) and the groups into activity headings (by the addition of one digit to the group number). For example:<br><br>Division 4 Other manufacturing industries<br>Class (G(Group) Activity*<br>48 	Processing of rubber and plastics<br><br>	(481)1 Rubber tyres and inner tubes<br>	(481)2 Other rubber products<br>	(482)0 Retreading and specialist repairing of rubber tyres<br><br>*Activity is given by four digits ie 4811 = Rubber tyres and inner tubes.<br><br>The classification is made up of 10 divisions, 60 classes, 222 groups and 334 activity headings. In general the activity headings have been used in the coding. A summary of the classification used in the census is given at Appendix D of Classification of occupations, 1980.<br><br>The classification of some activities presents conceptual problems, for example, head offices which are located at a different location from the place where the main activities are carried out, or repair work carried out by the manufacturers or distributors of the goods concerned. Methods for dealing with such problems are set out in the introduction to the Standard Industrial Classification, Revised 1980.</p>

                        <h2 id="LOWLEV_1981">Lowest Level of Buildings</h2><p>Level of household’s accommodation<br><br>The enumerator was asked to code at section (e) the location of the household’s accommodation within the building in relation to ground level:<br><br>Level of household's accommodation — tick only one box<br><br>a.	All on ground or on ground and other floors<br>b.	All in basement<br>c. 	All on first or higher floor (State actual floor of entry to household's accommodation if box c is ticked)<br><br>The following advice was given to enumerators:<br>“In completing this section you are concerned with the floor on which the entry to the household’s living accommodation is situated. Do not confuse floors with storeys, eg ground floor is usually the first storey and the first floor, the second storey. Remember too that each level within a maisonette is included in determining floor number."</p>

Single<br>2. Married (1st marriage)<br>3. Re-married<br>4. Divorced<br>5. Widowed<br><br>In Scotland the re-married category (3) was not included and separated people were instructed to tick “married”.<br><br>The marital status of a person was taken from the tick-box selected. That is, single persons are persons who have never married (spinsters and bachelors). Married (first marriage) persons are those whose first marriage had not ended by divorce or death of the husband/wife, including persons who were separated but not divorced from their spouse. Re-married persons are those who married again aftertheir first or subsequent marriage(s) ended in divorce or death of spouse and who were still married at the time of the census. Married (first marriage) plus re-married gives the married population. Widowed persons are those whose latest marriage ended because of the death of their spouse and divorced persons are those whose latest marriage ended in divorce.</p>

Works mainly at home<br><br>Where more than one box was ticked in the question on daily journey to work the lowest number was coded - for example, if box 1 and 6 were ticked then code 1 was taken (British Rail train). If workplace was given as “mainly at home" and any box 1 to 9 was ticked in the question on daily journey to work then the occupation of the person was examined in order to decide how to correct the inconsistency. For persons such as shopkeepers, itinerant salesmen, doctors etc, the workplace was accepted as “mainly at home” and the daily journey to work coded accordingly, i.e. a code 1 to 9 was disregarded. For persons such as vehicle drivers and tradesmen(plumbers, decorators etc), the workplace was amended to No fixed place and the daily journey to work was coded as entered on the form (subject to the constraint on multiple codes). The tables show an other or not stated category of daily journey to work; the category consists of those persons who failed to answer the question on daily journey to work or who selected the “other” box but could not be assigned to another code or who selected the box “works mainly at home” but gave an address of place of work other than “mainly at home”.</p>
                        <h2 id="NPRHH_1981">Persons per room</h2><p>Measurements of under occupancy or overcrowding are given by density of occupation ie. the ratio of the number of persons in a private household with usual residents to the number of rooms accommodation of that household.</p>

                        <h2 id="OCCHOUS_1981">Occupied Households</h2><p>Households (in permanent buildings) which consisted entirely of visitors were sub-divided by type of tenure into owner occupied and not owner occupied (c and d above) to give an approximate measure of second homes (i.e. category c) and holiday accommodation (i.e. category d) that was occupied on census night.</p>
                        <h2 id="OCCTYPE_1981">Occupancy Type</h2><p>Occupancy type<br>The list of occupancy types in the order they appear in the tables is as follows:<br><br>a. Private households with residents (ie enumerated households with one or more usual residents, whether present or absent)<br><br>b. Absent households (ie private households with one or more usual residents, all absent on census night and no other person present on census night)<br><br>c. Enumerated households with no usual residents (ie all visitors) Tenure recorded as “owner occupier”<br><br>d. Enumerated households with no usual residents (ie all visitors) Tenure recorded as anything other than owner occupier<br><br>e. Second residences not occupied on census night<br><br>f.

Vacant (Other)<br><br><br>Household spaces occupied on census night comprised the three categories a, c and d above. Enumerators classified household spaces not occupied on census night into the remaining six categories (i.e. b, e, f, g, h and i).<br><br>Vacant:<br>Enumerators were given the following instructions:<br><br>“Treat as vacant any residential accommodation where:<br><br>— The property is new and ready for occupation but not yet occupied: V (New)<br><br>— the accommodation is in the course of conversion or improvement (renovation or decoration) and is not yet occupied: V (Imp)<br><br>— the property is clearly without furniture or you obtain reliable information that the Property is not occupied eg. awaiting new tenants, occupier deceased: V (Oth)"<br><br>Vacant (Under improvement) covers a wide range of types of improvement from major structual alteration to inside decoration. It would not have been practicable to obtain a finer distinction of types because reliable information on the improvement may not have been obvious or easy to obtain. Tests prior to the census indicated some mis-classification between Vacant (Under improvement) and Vacant (Other). Nevertheless this division of previously “occupied but vacant accommodation should provide reasonable measures of accommodation either ready - Vacant (Other) - or not ready - Vacant (Imp) - for occupation at census time.</p>
                        <h2 id="PERSPRES_1981">Persons present</h2><p>The form-filler was instructed to include on the census form:<br><br>“all the persons who spend census night 5-6 April 1981 in this household (including anyone visiting overnight and anyone who arrives here on the Monday and who has not been included as present on another census form).”<br><br>"any persons who usually live with your household but who are absent on census night. For example, on holiday, in hospital, at school or college. Include them even if you know that they are being put on another census form elsewhere.”<br><br>An identical instruction but in a different format was included on the form H in Scotland.

It is important to know exactly what is being counted, i.e. the population base, especially when comparing tables from the 1981 Census with those from earlier censuses or from non-census<br>sources.<br><br>The form used in the 1981 Census contains two changes from the form used in the 1971 Census that affect the population bases, namely:<br><br>a. all questions relating to the individual on the H form were addressed to absent residents (see paragraph 16 for the description of an absent resident). However, as in 1971, in communal establishments only the population present on census night was enumerated.<br><br>b. the whereabouts question on the H form identified those absent residents who were elsewhere in Great Britain on census night and those who were outside GB.<br><br>Absent households, ie. households which were wholly absent from their place of usual residence were not included in the enumerationRoo if no one else was present in that accommodation on census night. (In 1971 the absent residents in such households were included in the Household Composition Tables to the extent that it had been possible to enumerate them).</p>

However, for persons having the employment status of foreman or manager, the following additional rules apply:<br><br>(a) each occupation is given a basic social class<br><br>(b) persons of foreman status whose basic social class is IV or V are allocated to Social Class III<br><br>(c) persons of manager status are allocated to Social Class II except for the following:<br><br>	Social Class I for group 007.1<br>	Social Class III for groups 039.4 and 057.3 and if the basic class is IV or V.<br><br>Head of household (sample processing) has been regarded as the person entered in the first column of the census form provided that person was:<br><br>a. aged 16 years or over, and<br>b. usually resident at This address.<br><br>If one of these conditions was not met, the first person aged 16 years or over to be entered on the form and recorded as usually resident at "This address", who was not a domestic servant was classified as the head. In the last resort the oldest resident under 16 years of age would be taken as head. No head was identified in those households consisting entirely of visitors or domestic servants.<br>This definition differs from the corresponding definition in para 85 because of the additional ruling concerning domestic servants.</p>
                        <h2 id="TENURE_1981">Tenure</h2><p>Tenure<br><br>The tenure of a household was obtained from the answers to question H2:<br><br>H2 Tenure<br><br>How do you and your household occupy your accommodation?<br>Please tick the appropriate box.<br><br>As an owner occupier (including purchase by mortgage):<br>1. of freehold property<br>2. of leasehold property<br><br>By renting, rent free or by lease:<br>3. from a local authority (council or New Town)<br>4. with a job, shop, farm or other business<br>5. from a housing association or charitable trust<br>6. furnished from a private landlord, company or other organisation<br>7. unfurnished from a private landiord, company or other organisation<br><br>In some other way:<br>Please give details<br><br>Note<br>a If the accommodation is occupied by lease originally granted for, or since extended to, more than 21 years, tick box 2.<br><br>b If a share in the property is being bought under an arrangement with a local authority, New Town corporation or housing association, for example, shared ownership (equity sharing), a co-ownership<br>scheme, tick box 1 or 2 as appropriate.<br><br>The division of owner occupiers into freehold and leasehold, and the categories of renting etc. with a job, shop, farm or other business and renting etc. from a housing association or charitable trust were extensions to the tenure question included in the 1971 Census.<br><br>The highest box (lowest code number) was coded if more than one box was ticked. A set of coding instructions was drawn up, in consultation with the Department of Environment, for coding answers specified under In some other way. For example, “relative’s property” or “squatting” were assigned to renting etc. furnished or unfurnished, as appropriate. <br>A copy of the coding instructions is available from Customer Services, Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, Titchfield, Fareham, Hants, PO15 5RR.<br><br>The household tenure for renting etc with a job, shop, farm or other business was divided in processing by reference to the employment status (see para 99) of the first person on the form, as<br>follows:<br><br>Tenure is "Renting with a business" if Employment status of first person is "Self employed"<br><br>Tenure is "Renting by virtue of employment" if Employment status of first person is "Employee or apprentice or employment trainee"<br><br>If the first person had no employment status, ie. not applicable (again see para 99), the household tenure was allocated to renting unfurnished.</p>
                        <h2 id="UNIT_1981">Unit</h2><p>The unit of measurement for the particular count.</p>
                        <h2 id="URESPOP_1981">Usual Resident Population</h2><p>Usual residence<br><br>For most persons the answer to the question on usual address is straightforward. For some, however, it is not so, particularly when a person lives at more than one address throughout the year.<br>Guidance by the Census Offices took three forms. They were:-<br><br>a. The inclusion of specific notes with the usual address question on the H and I forms (see para 17 for the H form notes). The note for the I form read, "If you are a student or a schoolchild away from home during term time your home address should be taken as your usual address.”<br><br>b. Limited guidance to the enumerator on whom to treat as usually living at this address for the purposes of completing an H form. This guidance was given at Appendix A of the Field Manual in England and Wales (not issued in Scotland). A copy of the Appendix is shown on page 7.<br><br>c. Leaflets (UA in England and Wales and UR in Scotland) distributed in communal establishments for the sick and disabled advising patients how to answer the question on usual address. A copy of UA is shown on page 8.<br><br>The following rules were laid down for inmates of prisons, borstals and detention centres. If a prisoner had served six months or more of a sentence in custody (not necessarily in the same prison or establishment) immediately prior to 5 April 1981, the usual address was taken to be this address. If the prisoner had served less than six months, the usual address before admission was to be given. A similar procedure was followed for children in community homes.<br><br>Where the question on usual address was not answered the auto-edit imputed a code of this address or elsewhere not stated. A reponse of “none” or "no fixed address” was coded to this address; but the record for such a person would be included in the processing only if the answer to the question on whereabouts was "here".<br><br>Persons who failed to answer the question or who stated " none” or "no fixed address" appear as part of the usually resident population (on either basis of measurement) in the area in which they were enumerated; but they are included as part of a private household with usual residents only if assigned a code of this address.<br><br>Form H - Usual address<br>If the person usually lives here please tick 'This address'. If not, tick 'Elsewhere' and write in the person's usual address.<br><br>The home address should be taken as the usual address for a head of household who lives away from home for part of the work.<br><br>For students and children away from home during term time, the home address should be taken as the usual address.<br><br>Boarders should be asked what they consider to be their usual address.<br><br>Note: Usual Address question. If the box "This address" had been ticked, the input into the computer was the code of the enumeration district; if an address elsewhere in the United Kingdom had been given, the input was the postcode; if an address out-side the United Kingdom had been given, the input was the country of usual residence (using the codes for the country of birth classification - see para 74). Special procedures were adopted if the answer was missing or was entered as "none" or "no fixed address” (see para 27).<br><br></p>
                        <h2 id="WELLANGS_1981">Welsh</h2><p>Welsh language<br><br>The Welsh language question was as follows:<br><br>W Welsh language <br><br>For all person aged 3 or over (born before 6 April 1878). <br>a Does the person speak Welsh?
